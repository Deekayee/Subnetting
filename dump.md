**Subnetting documentation**

The tool provides step-by-step guidance for calculating:

- Subnet masks  
- Network addresses  
- Broadcast addresses  
- Valid host ranges 


**File Structure**

Program is composed by 3 files:

- subnetting.cpp -> responsible for hosting the main function of our program
- network.h -> containing the class structures to better organize the program
- headers.h -> will host all the declarations and included libraries for our program to work
- A nameless contender which will be defining the functions declared in headers.h

Since the main objective of this program is to simply aid in subnetting calculations for students, no file reading or user verification is needed.
Program contents are stored in memory.
